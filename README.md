[English](README.md) | [中文](docs/README.zh.md)

A library of Claude Skills and slash commands that turns a chat agent into a marketing operator across **three disciplines on one operating contract**:

- **SEO/GEO** — **26 skills**: keyword research, content creation, programmatic/parasite/local/comparison builds, on-page & technical audits, schema, site architecture, rank/backlink/AI-traffic monitoring, plus the quality, entity, and memory protocol layer.
- **Influencer marketing (IMPACT)** — **18 skills**: audience insight, creator discovery & fit scoring, campaign planning, briefs, outreach, content review, amplification, UGC repurposing, and ROI tracking.
- **Paid ads (ROAS)** — **8 skills**: account structure, audience segments, ad creative, experiment design, the account-audit gate, conversion-signal QA, the measurement loop, and attribution reconciliation.

Everything is **plain Markdown** (the only code is a Bash hook runner, a Bash validator, and zero-dependency Python-stdlib data helpers — no `pip`, no build step). **Every skill runs at Tier 1 with nothing but data you paste in**; optional connectors only automate retrieval. Four scoring frameworks ship inside and back the publish/trust/quality gates: [CORE-EEAT](references/core-eeat-benchmark.md), [CITE](references/cite-domain-rating.md), [C³](references/c3-benchmark.md), and [ROAS](references/roas-benchmark.md).

> The SEO/GEO half also ships on its own, unchanged, at [seo-geo-claude-skills](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills) for users who only want SEO/GEO work.

## Why this library

| Principle | What it means in practice |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Keyless by default** | Every skill works at **Tier 1** with data you paste or pull from free/first-party sources. Paid tools and MCP servers are an opt-in convenience, never a precondition. Paid-ads skills score from your **own-account manual export** — keyed ad APIs are never required. |
| **Markdown, not a framework** | Skills are content. The only executable code is `hooks/claude-hook.sh` (Bash), `scripts/validate-skill.sh` (Bash), and `scripts/connectors/*.py` (Python **standard library only**). Nothing to install, audit, or keep up to date. |
| **One shared contract** | All 52 skills expose the same seven sections, so the library behaves like one operating system: each skill knows its inputs, outputs, and the next best skill to hand off to. |
| **Gated quality** | Four benchmarks ([CORE-EEAT](references/core-eeat-benchmark.md), [CITE](references/cite-domain-rating.md), [C³](references/c3-benchmark.md), [ROAS](references/roas-benchmark.md)) drive four auditor-class gates that emit structured, machine-checkable verdicts — not vibes. |
| **Memory across turns** | A HOT/WARM/COLD memory model carries findings, scores, and open loops between skills and sessions, sanitized on the way in. |
| **Plain voice** | Skills ship an AI-slop detector and a banned-phrase list so output reads like a human wrote it. |

---

## Install

Use it with Claude Code, any Agent Skills-compatible host, or a plain `git clone`:

| Host | Install |
|------|---------|
| **Claude Code** | `/plugin marketplace add aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills` then `/plugin install aaron-marketing@aaron` |
| **skills.sh / generic Agent Skills hosts** | `npx skills add aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills` |
| **Any host** | `git clone https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills` |

In Claude Code, `marketplace add` only registers the catalog — run `/plugin install aaron-marketing@aaron` (or pick it from `/plugin`) to actually enable the skills and commands. To pull a **single** skill on a generic host: `npx skills add aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills -s keyword-research`.

Installing the plugin adds **nothing** to your `/mcp` list — the MCP catalogue in `.mcp.json` is a copy-paste reference, not auto-registered (see [Connectors](#connectors--enhancement-tiers)).

---

## First run

If your host supports automatic skill routing, just describe the goal:

```text
Research keywords for my SaaS product targeting small teams
```
```text
Find TikTok creators for a skincare launch and score their fit
```
```text
Audit this Google Ads account before I scale — exports attached
```

Or drive the SEO/GEO workflow with a slash command:

```text
/aaron-marketing:auto audit https://example.com/blog/my-article
```

`/aaron-marketing:auto` infers intent and runs the smallest useful workflow, stopping only at blocking decisions. Every skill works with pasted data; optional tools are documented in [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md).

---

## Operating model

Every skill follows the **same activation contract** — seven sections in a fixed order:

1. **Trigger / when-to-use** — when the skill should fire.
2. **Quick Start** — copy-paste prompts.
3. **Skill Contract** — Expected output · Reads · Writes · Promotes · Done-when · Primary next skill.
4. **Handoff Summary** — the standard hand-off shape so the next skill picks up cleanly.
5. **Data Sources** — `~~category` placeholders, each with a keyless Tier-1 path.
6. **Instructions** — the numbered method (treats all exports as untrusted input).
7. **Next Best Skill** — where to go next.

This is documented once in [skill-contract.md](references/skill-contract.md); the shared cross-skill state lives in [state-model.md](references/state-model.md).

### The protocol layer

Four cross-cutting skills + two auditor-class consumers form the protocol layer. Auditor-class skills write a **gated artifact** (`class: auditor-output`) that a PostToolUse hook validates before it lands:

| Protocol skill | Role | Framework | Writes to |
|----------------|------|-----------|-----------|
| `content-quality-auditor` | Publish-readiness gate | CORE-EEAT | `memory/audits/<skill>/` |
| `domain-authority-auditor` | Citation-trust gate | CITE | `memory/audits/<skill>/` |
| `content-reviewer` | Creator-content gate (C³ ART) | C³ | `memory/audits/influencer/` |
| `ad-account-auditor` | Paid-account gate (ROAS RQS) | ROAS | `memory/audits/paid/` |
| `entity-optimizer` | Canonical entity profile | — | `memory/` |
| `memory-management` | HOT/WARM/COLD memory loop | — | `memory/` |

Gate mechanics — handoff schema, cap arithmetic, and the artifact-gate checklist — are specified once in [auditor-runbook.md](references/auditor-runbook.md).

---

## Quality frameworks

Four benchmarks make "good" measurable. Each defines dimensions, a rollup method, and a small set of **veto items** (hard fails that cap or block a score regardless of the rest).

| Framework | Scores | Items / dimensions | Rollup | Veto items | Used by |
|-----------|--------|--------------------|--------|------------|---------|
| **[CORE-EEAT](references/core-eeat-benchmark.md)** | Content quality (GEO = CORE avg, SEO = EEAT avg) | 80 items / 8 dimensions | per-dimension averages | `T04`, `C01`, `R10` | `content-quality-auditor`, `/audit` |
| **[CITE](references/cite-domain-rating.md)** | Domain authority & citation trust | 40 items / 4 dimensions | arithmetic weighted mean | `T03`, `T05`, `T09` | `domain-authority-auditor` |
| **[C³](references/c3-benchmark.md)** | Influencer Creator / Content / Campaign | ACE / ART / ROI · 9 dimensions | **CVI = (ACE × ART × ROI)^⅓** (geometric) | ACE `A2`/`C1`/`E2`, ART `T1`/`T2` | `fit-scorer` (ACE), `content-reviewer` (ART) |
| **[ROAS](references/roas-benchmark.md)** | Paid ads Return / Offer / Audience / Spend-efficiency | R / O / A / S | **RQS = floor(goal-weighted mean)** (arithmetic) | `R1`/`R2`/`O1`/`O2`/`A1` | `ad-account-auditor` |

**Cap method (shared):** a single veto caps the affected dimension and the overall at `min(raw, 60)`; **two or more vetoes → `BLOCKED`** (no final score). Verdicts are translated to plain language for the user (no item IDs in the rendered report). The arithmetic for all four frameworks is locked by a deterministic golden test (see [Quality guards](#quality-guards-ci)).

### Paid Ads — ROAS (8)

Phases are the conceptual **ROAS loop** (Research → Orchestrate → Activate → Scale); all paid skills live flat under `paid/`. Only `ad-account-auditor` computes the goal-weighted RQS and runs the five vetoes — every other skill operates on a single lever and hands off.

| Phase | Skills |
|-------|--------|
| **Research** | [campaign-architect](paid/campaign-architect/SKILL.md), [audience-segment-builder](paid/audience-segment-builder/SKILL.md) |
| **Orchestrate** | [ad-creative-builder](paid/ad-creative-builder/SKILL.md), [ad-test-designer](paid/ad-test-designer/SKILL.md) |
| **Activate** | [ad-account-auditor](paid/ad-account-auditor/SKILL.md), [conversion-signal-qa](paid/conversion-signal-qa/SKILL.md) |
| **Scale** | [paid-measurement-loop](paid/paid-measurement-loop/SKILL.md), [attribution-reconciler](paid/attribution-reconciler/SKILL.md) |

<details><summary><b>Per-skill purpose (Paid Ads)</b></summary>

| Skill | ROAS lever | What it does |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| campaign-architect | A + structure | Account/campaign structure, campaign-type fit, match types, negatives/exclusions, paid↔organic cannibalization; carries a recurring **search-term-mining** mode. |
| audience-segment-builder | A | Turns your own customer/CRM/GA4 export into seed audiences, lookalike seeds, exclusion segments, and a funnel-stage targeting map. |
| ad-creative-builder | O | RSA headlines/descriptions, hooks, and an angle matrix, message-matched to the destination page. |
| ad-test-designer | O (+S) | Design A/B/n & incrementality tests (hypothesis, variant matrix, sample size/power) and read out significance → promote/kill. |
| ad-account-auditor | R+O+A+S (RQS) | Auditor-class ROAS gate: scores RQS, enforces R1/R2/O1/O2/A1, emits SHIP/FIX/BLOCK; carries a **launch go/no-go** mode. |
| conversion-signal-qa | R | Pre-launch tracking QA (event firing, UTM hygiene, dedup gate, window alignment, iOS-ATT flags) — the R1/R2 prerequisite (builds the signal; the auditor scores it). |
| paid-measurement-loop | R (+S) | Read one shipped change back against a control over a window → Promote / Keep-testing / Rollback / Unproven. |
| attribution-reconciler | R | Standing order-ID de-dup against the GA4/ecommerce truth set, window/currency normalization, model comparison, incrementality. |

**Reused cross-discipline** (counted in the phases, not duplicated): [budget-optimizer](plan/budget-optimizer/SKILL.md) (spend + bid-pacing/learning-phase mode), [landing-optimizer](convert/landing-optimizer/SKILL.md) (post-click), [roi-calculator](track/roi-calculator/SKILL.md) (return math), [report-generator](track/report-generator/SKILL.md), [performance-analyzer](track/performance-analyzer/SKILL.md).

## Commands

Five commands cover the SEO/GEO workflow end-to-end; influencer and paid skills are reached by name or via `/aaron-marketing:auto` routing. Source: [commands/](commands/).

| Command | Use it for | Flags |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| `/aaron-marketing:auto` | Describe any goal — infers intent and runs the smallest useful workflow | `--deep` (exhaustive / stress-test) |
| `/aaron-marketing:research` | Keyword demand, SERP intent, competitors, content gaps, site/topic/entity maps | — |
| `/aaron-marketing:create` | Brief, write, series, refresh, CMS-neutral publish package | `--brief` `--series` `--refresh` `--publish` `--meta` `--schema` |
| `/aaron-marketing:audit` | On-page + CORE-EEAT quality, technical SEO, AI visibility, domain authority | `--full` `--tech` `--visibility` `--authority` |
| `/aaron-marketing:track` | Rankings, alerts, performance reports, project memory | `--alert` `--report` `--remember` |

Daily work normally starts with `/aaron-marketing:auto`, which runs the workflow implied by your goal and stops only at blocking decisions. The other four are explicit mode entrypoints.

**Rename note:** commands use the `/aaron-marketing:` prefix. Older `/seo:*` and `/aaron-seo-geo:*` names recover via `auto` — e.g. `/aaron-marketing:auto /aaron-seo-geo:audit https://example.com/blog/post` returns `/aaron-marketing:audit https://example.com/blog/post`.

---

## Connectors & enhancement tiers

Skills name tools with `~~category` placeholders (`~~SEO tool`, `~~web analytics`, `~~ad platform`, …) instead of specific vendors, and every category has a **keyless Tier-1 path**. Full recipes — including the free/first-party endpoint for each category — are in [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md).

| Tier | Requires | You get |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Tier 1** (default) | Nothing | Paste data, or pull it from free/public sources. The full analysis framework runs either way. |
| **Tier 2** | One free first-party API or MCP | Automatic retrieval of your own GSC / GA4 / Core Web Vitals data. |
| **Tier 3** | A fuller MCP set | Fully automated multi-source workflows. |

- **Bundled zero-dependency helpers** under `scripts/connectors/` (Python stdlib only) pull public/own data locally — e.g. PageSpeed/CrUX, Open PageRank, page crawl, Wayback CDX, Wikidata SPARQL, Common Crawl, advertools recipes.
- **Free/keyless sources** documented per category: Google Search Console & GA4 (own data), PageSpeed/CrUX, Wikidata, Common Crawl, Open PageRank, and more.
- **Opt-in MCP servers** (Ahrefs, Semrush, SE Ranking, SISTRIX, SimilarWeb, the self-hosted free **OpenSEO** suite, Cloudflare, Vercel, HubSpot, Amplitude, Notion, Webflow, Sanity, Contentful, Slack) are catalogued in `.mcp.json` as a **copy-paste reference only** — they are not auto-registered, so installing the plugin adds nothing to your `/mcp` list. Copy the entries you want into your own MCP config.

Paid-ads skills score from your **own-account manual export** (native ad-manager CSV, GA4, ecommerce). Keyed ad-platform APIs (Google Ads SDK, Meta Marketing API) are opt-in Tier-2/3 only and **never** a Tier-1 requirement.

---

## Memory & automation hooks

**Memory** is temperature-tiered, so context survives across skills and sessions without bloating the prompt:

| Tier | Location | Behavior |
|------|----------|----------|
| **HOT** | `memory/hot-cache.md` | Auto-loaded each session; capped at **80 lines AND 25 KB** (whichever trips first). |
| **WARM** | `memory/<subdir>/` | Per-skill working state and gated audit artifacts. |
| **COLD** | `memory/archive/` | Demoted/older records, kept for recall. |

**Hooks** (`hooks/hooks.json`, runner `hooks/claude-hook.sh`) wire four Claude Code events:

| Event | Matcher | What it does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| `SessionStart` | `startup\|resume\|clear\|compact` | Injects the **sanitized** hot-cache + an open-loops pointer (prompt-injection lines are redacted; symlinked caches are rejected). |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | (all) | Lightweight per-prompt context hook. |
| `PostToolUse` | `Write\|Edit` | Hot-cache size warning **+ the Artifact Gate**: anything written under `memory/audits/` must carry `class: auditor-output` and the cap fields, or the write is blocked. |
| `Stop` | (all) | No-op (exits silently). |

The Artifact Gate is **framework-agnostic** — the same hook validates CORE-EEAT, CITE, C³, and ROAS audit artifacts with no per-framework code.

---

## Recommended workflows

**SEO/GEO**
1. **Research** — `keyword-research` → `competitor-analysis` → `content-gap-analysis`
2. **Build** — `seo-content-writer` → `geo-content-optimizer` → `meta-tags-optimizer` / `schema-markup-generator`
3. **Optimize** — `content-quality-auditor` → `on-page-seo-auditor` → `technical-seo-checker`
4. **Monitor** — `rank-tracker` → `performance-reporter` → `alert-manager`

**Influencer (IMPACT)**
1. **Insight** — `audience-analyzer` → `trend-spotter` → `niche-researcher`
2. **Map** — `influencer-discovery` → `fit-scorer` (C³ ACE) → `competitor-tracker`
3. **Plan** — `campaign-planner` → `brief-generator` → `budget-optimizer`
4. **Activate** — `outreach-manager` → `content-reviewer` (ART gate) → `contract-helper`
5. **Convert** — `content-amplifier` → `ugc-repurposer` → `landing-optimizer`
6. **Track** — `performance-analyzer` → `roi-calculator` → `report-generator`

**Paid Ads (ROAS loop)**
1. **Research** — `audience-segment-builder` → `campaign-architect`
2. **Orchestrate** — `ad-creative-builder` → `ad-test-designer` (+ `landing-optimizer` for the page)
3. **Activate** — `conversion-signal-qa` → `ad-account-auditor` (RQS gate) before any budget goes live
4. **Scale** — `paid-measurement-loop` → `attribution-reconciler` → `roi-calculator` → `report-generator`

For a full trust review, pair `content-quality-auditor` with `domain-authority-auditor` for a combined 120-item assessment. With `memory-management` active, handoffs and open loops are retained in HOT/WARM/COLD memory automatically.

## Design philosophy

- **Skills are content.** The only code is the Bash validator, the Bash hook runner, and zero-dependency Python-stdlib connector/check helpers. No third-party / `pip` dependencies, ever — enforced by a dependency-creep guard.
- **Keyless first.** Every `~~category` has a free/own-data recipe; MCP and paid tools are pure convenience.
- **Surgical & MECE.** Each skill owns one job with a crisp scope boundary; overlapping work is shipped as a *mode* of an existing skill rather than a new thin skill.
- **No invented numbers.** Skills label every figure Measured / User-provided / Estimated and ship an AI-slop / banned-phrase detector.
- **Compliance is guidance, not law.** FTC-disclosure and claim-integrity checks flag risk; they are not legal advice.

---

## Quality guards (CI)

Every change runs against a set of fail-closed guards (all in `scripts/` and `tests/`):

| Guard | Checks |
|-------|--------|
| `validate-skill.sh` | Frontmatter, required sections, version consistency, plugin-relative links across all 52 skills. |
| `golden-auditor-math.py` | Deterministic weight-sum + worked-example arithmetic for **all four** frameworks. |
| `check-evals.py` | Eval structural lint + `structure-manifest.json` (52/52 skills carry eval cases). |
